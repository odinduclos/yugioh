  "readme": "## JugglingDB-Nano [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jugglingdb/nano-adapter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jugglingdb/nano-adapter)\n\nCouchDB-nano adapter for jugglingdb.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use it you need `jugglingdb@0.2.x`.\n\n1. Setup dependencies in `package.json`:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      ...\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"jugglingdb\": \"0.2.x\",\n        \"jugglingdb-nano\": \"latest\"\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Use:\n\n    ```javascript\n        var Schema = require('jugglingdb').Schema;\n        var schema = new Schema('nano', {url: 'http://localhost:5984/nano-test'});\n        ...\n    ```\n\n## Working with your database\n\n### Automatic creation of views for indexes\n\nThis adapter will automatically create several design documents on your database:\n 1. `\\_design/nano` document contains `by\\_model` view that maps documents to their model property, if such exists.\n 2. For each model that has at least one property with `indexed: true` it will create one design document named `\\_design/nano-<model name>` and one view named `by\\_<property name>` for each indexed property.\n\n### Automatic use of created views\n\nDuring querying of database this adapter will:\n 1. Try to automatically leverage the views it created if an indexed property is used in `where`.\n 2. Fallback to using `nano/\\_by_model` view to reduce the number of documents it has to scan.\n\n### Query parameters\n\n- All queries to the database use `include_docs` set to `true`\n- jugglingdb's `offset` is used as `skip` query parameter\n- jugglingdb's `limit` is used as `limit` query parameter\n\n## Known issues\n\n- jugglingdb's `findOne` (and methods that depend on it) has to be used only for keys with unique indexes as it passes `limit` of 1 to the adapter which then retrieves just the first document in the view which may or may not match the other `where` conditions.\n\n## Running tests\n\nMake sure you have couchdb server running on default port\n\n    npm test\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease make changes to files in the `src` folder and then compile with `cake build` before sending a pull request.\n\n## MIT License\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
